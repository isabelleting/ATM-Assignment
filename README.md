## Description 

An exercise with MIT xPro where the user can deposit and withdraw money from their account. The Submit button will be disabled if the user tries to witdraw more than the account has. 

## How To Run

After loading in a browser window, simply select from the dropdown Deposit or Cash Back to make the transaction.
